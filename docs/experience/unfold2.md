::: danger Comfortable to use
My period is so all over the place, this box has came in handy. It has all absorbance sizes. They are easy to use. They are comfortable to wear even for longer periods of time. I have experienced no discomfort while using them. The tampons themselves are super absorbent. I honestly don't have anything bad to say. I am more than happy with how easy they are to use and with how well they actually work.
