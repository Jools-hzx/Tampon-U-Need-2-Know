I love the variety box so I can use the appropriate size for different period days. I think these are great for any period heaviness, and they are excellent quality. They're easy to throw in my purse so I always have some ready for anyone who may need one while I'm out. The plastic isn't loud, but it's 2023 and we're not ashamed of having periods. Periods are normal."
