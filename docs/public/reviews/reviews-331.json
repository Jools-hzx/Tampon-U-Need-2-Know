    "content": "Tampax Pearl is my normal go to for my monthly cycle. However, instead of purchasing different boxes for various flows, this box contains 3 different flow levels, regular, super and super plus. Considering my flow can change on a daily basis, this box gives me 3 different options to have on hand each month. Considering they are a plastic applicator, they are much easier to insert than a cardboard applicator."
