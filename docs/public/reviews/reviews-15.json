    "content": "Good product I've been using for years and is my usual go to for feminine products. It's great to have for different flow days and I like that it has more regular flow, because that's what I usually use. My only issue with this pack is that they're all mixed around and you end up digging around to try to find the right one. Yes they have a small bit of color difference, but still looking down on them in the box it's hard to tell them apart so I have to shuffle around a bit."
