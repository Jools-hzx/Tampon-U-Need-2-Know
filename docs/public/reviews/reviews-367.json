    "content": "The pearl tampons are a favorite of mine for the perfect gentle glide when inserting. If you are sensitive below then it's perfect as far as comfort. The absorption is great and the braided rope provides the extra protection. I have been using this same product for over 4 years and it was always be a staple in my home. Variety packs are great for new starters to figure out the size you need as well as perfect for the different flow amounts."
