    "content": "I thought I'd give these a try again, but I ended up tossing the entire box in the garbage. I miss the old compak plastic tampons. They had a nice grip in the center that I could hold with my nail during insert. This new design is not user friendly at all. I use the drug store brand here in Toronto, Canada, as they are the only ones with a similar old tampax design."
