    "content": "I've always been a fan of Tampax because the products are effective and well-made. These are no exception to that. The plastic applicator is easy to hold and the product is appropriately absorbent. It's nice that this box comes with a variety of sizes and with plenty of tampons so it's long-lasting and can be used throughout an entire cycle."
