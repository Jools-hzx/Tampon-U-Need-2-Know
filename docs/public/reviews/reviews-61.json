    "content": "This multipack has 3 different sizes: 18 Regular, 8 Super and 8 Super Plus. I love buying the multi pack because I'll wear tampons throughout my cycle and I don't need the same absorbency each day, it's nice to not have to buy multiple boxes to get all the different sizes. The wrappers are color coordinated but I wish there was more distinction between the colors. The wrappers are mostly white with blue & teal leaves then accents of yellow, green, orange for the 3 sizes. I just wish it was easier to tell the difference when grabbing from the top down into the box. I remember when the braided strings first came out and I've liked that idea ever since. The dark blue applicators are rounded and smooth. It's a comfortable fit with good absorbency. The box seems to list all the ingredients so you can decide if it's a good choice for you."
