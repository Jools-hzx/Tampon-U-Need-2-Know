    "content": "Ever since having baby #3, my periods the first day or 2 are BRUTAL. I all of a sudden started bleeding through everything overnight and would have to set an alarm to wake up and change. I started using the Super Plus tampons on the first few days and they were a life saver. They lasted through the night and are easy to insert and remove. Once I am over the first 2 days I move to the supers which are perfect size for the middle of periods then for the end I use the regulars! These are so easy to throw in your bag on the go and the tabs make them super easy to open and the grips on the applicator make them a breeze to insert!"
