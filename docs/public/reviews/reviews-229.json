    "content": "This box of tampons is multipack which I loved because it saves having to buy multiple packs of tampons for all of your needs. The tampons are very comfortable and easy to use. You just insert them until the grip on the applicator. I found these easy to use and didnt experience any discomfort. The only thing about these is that they all didnt absorb well. Some times it would feel very wet but once removed it seems like it wasn't clearly absorbing the liquid and I was experiencing leaks. It may just take some time to figure out which ones to use during that time of the month as I wasn't very familiar with this brand before hand. They didnt have any weird smells either. They are small enough to fit into your pockets and purchases too without being noticeable."
