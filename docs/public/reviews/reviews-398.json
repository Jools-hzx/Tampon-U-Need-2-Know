    "content": "I have been using Tampax for years. I've really grown to like this brand as my top pick. They are consistent with quality which is important when it comes to feminine care. I like this package because it's got 3 absorbencies. During a typical cycle, I would go through regular and super. But now that I've had my first few cycles after pregnancy, I really need the super plus option also. I like that it's all in one pack and I don't have to buy a bunch of different ones. These are really easy to use and designed well."
