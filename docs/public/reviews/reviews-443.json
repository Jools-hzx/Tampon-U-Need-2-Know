    "content": "Tampax is my go to tampon but you cant beat this trio pack. Instead of the standard 2, you get three asorbencies in one pack. No more using a higher than needed absorbency and ending up with that dreaded dryness and itchiness due to it sucking up all of your own personal moisture. Pearls are so easy to insert, will never go back. I would definitely recommend these no matter what stage of your cycle you are in."
