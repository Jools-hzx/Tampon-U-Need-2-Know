I love that I can get one box with a variety of sizes instead of having to buy multiple different boxes. These tampons are my favorite. They are so easy to put in and take out. I love that the plastic applicator is rounded at tip and smooth all around for a comfortable insertion. The base also is formed to be able to easily grip on to with fingers. These are pretty absorbent and one of the only brands that do not irritate me."
