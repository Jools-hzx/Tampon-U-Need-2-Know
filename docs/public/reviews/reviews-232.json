    "content": "I got the Tampax Pearl Trio Pack, and they are my favorite go-to for feminine protection. The Trio Pack is such a great option as they come in varied absorbency sizes. I can use the regular at the beginning and end of my flow, and use the super, and super plus in the middle. No matter what stage my flow is in, this product offers the right amount of protection. The soft plastic applicator make them so easy to insert, and you can't feel them once they have been inserted. Overall, this product is my favorite go-to for period protection."
