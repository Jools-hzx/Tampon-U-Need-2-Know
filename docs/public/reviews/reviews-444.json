    "content": "I have always been a person that typically sticks with the same brand of things I really like! When the brand I used for years stopped making the tampons I loved, I gave these a try, and I haven't stopped using them since!!! The sizing is a bit smaller than what I was use to with the other brand, however, I haven't had issues with leaking. I love that the applicator is plastic and not cardboard, and the best part.... the wrapper DOES NOT COME OFF the tampon in your purse!!!!"
