    "content": "I love Tampax Pearl tampons. I trust the Tampax brand to never let me down with leaks or odors. The great thing about the Tampax Pearl is that they have an easy to insert plastic applicator. I also like the unique braided string on the Pearl tampons. This braid is amazing, because it absorbs any unexpected leaks right into the string, and holds it there. This trio pack is convenient, and cost effective. It is convenient to have the particular sized tampons I will need throughout my entire period in one handy box. It is money saving because instead of having to purchase three separate boxes of tampons, Tampax has simplified and condensed it all into one. I have the tampons I need at the start of my period, in the middle when it's heaviest, and at the end when it is tapering off. I feel like the Tampax brand really supports women, and understands how complicated monthly periods can be. I highly recommend the Tampax brand, especially these Tampax Pearl trio packs."
