I like that it does come in a variety pack for the days that I need the most protection, down to the days I need the least protection. Whatever the flow brings. The packaging is cute and discreet. As for using they are easy to use. The applicators make it easy to glide in. I highly recommend to everyone in need of menstural cycle protection. They are very durable for even your toughest cycle. Five stars for five star protection."
