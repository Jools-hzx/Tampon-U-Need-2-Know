    "content": "The tampon itself has great absorbency, but the applicator doesn't work well. With the latest box that I have, about 1 in 3 of the applicators actually work. So, you get to choose from throwing away a perfectly good tampon because it didn't push all the way out of the plastic body or pull out the actual tampon and insert it by hand in order to not waste money. I won't be buying these again, I'll stick to the cardboard one, the applicator is a sure shot."
