    "content": "Tampax---WHY are you switching to plastic applicators??? I HATE THESE!! Please bring back the cardboard that i have been using for over 30 years. This new plastic junk is just that -junk!!! plus, when using this plastic junk, i no longer get the same protection as before. It's as if the tampon has literally shrunk. I do not like this product and can't find the cardboard applicators anymore. If i can't find the cardboard applicators, I will switch to the Diva Cup. Works longer and better anyway. Bring back the CARDBOARD,, Please."
