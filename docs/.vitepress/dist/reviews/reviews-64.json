    "content": "It is so convenient to have 3 sizes in one pack, and the comfort level of the plastic applicator can't be beat. The \"leakguard\" technology they mention is just a nicely braided string, but so far it has been surprisingly effective. I wish I had these in my earlier days, because it would have made life so much more stress free. I do wish that they would not make the outer wrappers with white as the base color. It would be so much better if they were a dark color like black or navy to blend in with your jeans. I don't particularly care if people see me holding a tampon, but I also don't feel I have to broadcast it in a crowded office or restaurant, and it would be nice to be able to stick a dark blue or black wrapper in my jeans pocket and be on about my business without any fuss."
