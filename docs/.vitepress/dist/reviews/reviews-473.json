    "content": "Tampax is already a great brand, but now that I've tried Tampax pearl tampons I have a new favorite. I got the Triple pack which comes with Regular, Super, and Super Plus. So it has all the sizes you need to get you through your whole period, which is great. The leak guard protection works great, I had less leakage. They are also really comfortable."
