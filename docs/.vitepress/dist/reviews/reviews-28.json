    "content": "Tampax Pearl Trio is a blessing. Having all three of my cycles tampons in one box is the best. Regular for beginning and end, super for middle and super plus for nights. I love the leak guard braid it really does cut back on leakage and are very absorbent. The sleek plastic applicator puts it in the right spot. They are very comfortable and stay in place. The packaging is discreet and durable. They can be thrown in my purse without fear of opening. I have no complaints. The leak guard protection out beats other brands in my book. I recommend and if you haven't tried them give them a try."
