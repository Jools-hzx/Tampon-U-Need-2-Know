    "content": "I generally buy generic brand tampons. But decided to try these. The products feel and smell was great but the protection was horrible. Granted I understand different factors can cause things to not always working as expected. In this case though I feel that stating this product can protect up to 8 hours is false claim. At best I got 4 hrs. I could understand a claim of 8 if the average was in fact 6 or 7 hours. But to state 8 is reaching. These tampons vs the generic ones I usually buy do smell and feel better. The generic ones however protected me better."
