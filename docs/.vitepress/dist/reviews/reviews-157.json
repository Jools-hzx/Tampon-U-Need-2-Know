    "title": "Great feature of multisize packs!",
    "content": "This multipack has 3 different sizes: 18 Regular, 8 Super and 8 Super Plus. I love buying the multi pack because I'll wear tampons throughout my cycle and I don't need the same absorbency each day, it's nice to not have to buy multiple boxes to get all the different sizes. The color coordinated wrappers are a good idea but I wish there was more distinction between the colors. I wish it was easier to tell the difference when grabbing from the top down into the box. I remember when the braided strings first came out and I've liked that idea ever since. The applicators are rounded and smooth. and fit comfortably with good absorbency. The box list all the ingredients so you can decide if it's a good choice."
