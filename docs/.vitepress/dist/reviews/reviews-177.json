    "content": "Tampax pearl seems to offer the best protection for what I need, and this trio pack makes it convenient to have different sizes for different days of my cycle. The applicator makes them comfortable and easy to insert, and they absorb well. I do have a heavier flow, so it is nice to have the super plus included. I would have preferred more super than regular, since I can only really use the regular size at the very end of my cycle, but everybody has different needs! My only complaint is that all of the packaging designs look very similar between the different sizes, which can make it harder to find the correct one than necessary."
