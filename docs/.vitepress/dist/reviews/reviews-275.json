    "content": "As most menstruating people know that time of the month can be a real burden a pain in the blank if you will. It's not always easy to locate and find exactly what we need in the time we need it. I always shop in advance, and when I came across this Tampax pearl trail box, I was surprised that all three were in one single box. Being such, I did not have to get more than one box. One box will suffice for a regular length cycle. I was hopeful that the entire length of the period would be covered. However, light should also be included in the box if you ask me unless there's a quadruple box in which case I am totally on board with getting that because we all know we don't want to buy forever boxes are three different boxes for the same issue. We go through every month all in all it's a good buy and I would definitely recommend plastic applicators make insertion easy and the cotton tampon put my mind at ease."
