    "content": "I have used Tampax tampons not long after my first period and I can rely on them to work without fail. I love the absorbency Tampax tampons has.And they are easy to use with the rounded tip. I have only had maybe 3 leakage since I've been wearing them and that's been 20 years. The packaging is wonderful"
