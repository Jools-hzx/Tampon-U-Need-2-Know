    "content": "I like having the trio pack of tampons, as i go through different times of where i may have a heavy flow or moderate flow. In the beginning of my period, im always heavy the first three days, so this for sure is handy to use the super plus, then go on down the line to just super and then regular. Also, saves room in my closet to not have different size packages."
