    "content": "The Tampax Pearl Trio Pack of Heavy Tampons comes with three different absorbencies, including Regular, Super, and Super Plus, all in one convenient package. You choose from the different absorbancies to match your changing flow and get the protection you need. If you have leaks, go up an absorbency. If you find the tampon uncomfortable to remove, which I experienced on multiple occasions, go down an absorbency. You can get all-day comfort and protection for up to eight hours. Emphasis on up to eight hours of protection. I usually get about four to six hours of wear before noticing they will leak. These tampons feature an anti-slip grip on the applicator for easy application. They also feature a plastic applicator for easy application. As if that wasn't enough, these tampons are free of elemental chlorine bleaching, perfume, fragrance, latex, and dyes. I do wish that the Pearl line would adopt the CleanSeal Wrapper featured in their Radiant line, as I find it to be easier and more hygienic. With that being said, I would still recommend the Tampax Pearl Trio Pack!"
