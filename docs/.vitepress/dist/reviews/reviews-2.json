    "content": "I was an avid long user of Kotex (the ones they have discontinued. I can not remember the exact name of them). I was heart broken when they discontinued the product I had used since I was 16. I was in complete discomfort and had no clue what I was going to do or use. Since every thing I was buying and trying was terrible and nothing like what I was looking for. I was totally uncomfortable and felt completely out of my skin all bc of the tampons I was having or trying to use to find my new match. Then I discovered Tampax (again). They weren't the smaller fit in your pocket new thing everyone else was doing that I HATED!! They were the normal sized tampon. They are super comfy for a tampon and shark week. So as comfortable as you can be during shark week anyway! I absolutely love the 3 different sizes. A the amount of options and the sets of different sizes for different flows and different periods. As mine are not regular nor are they the same from one period to the next. Sometimes not even the same consistency from day to day lol!! Shark week is the absolute worst butttttt Tampax has def made it a little more bearable and comfortable considering us women have to literally not want to get out of bed or move for the 3-7 days once a month. A for some ladies it may be more or even less! So make the switch like I did ladies and thank me or really Tampax later! You won't regret it!!"
