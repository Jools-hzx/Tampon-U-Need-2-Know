    "content": "I like that these come in a trio pack because sometimes you need different absorbency's, it makes it very convenient, and I don't have to have multiple boxes in my cabinet. The plastic applicator is a must for me, it is much more comfortable to use than the cardboard. They work well but I would prefer if they were a little bit tapered wider at the top instead of being so straight."
