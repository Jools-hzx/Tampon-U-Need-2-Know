I slide one in my pant pocket and go on about my day with no worries of if anyone will know what I have in my pocket. Plus I can throw one in my purse and it doesn't scream, I'm a tampon!! They are comfortable and absorb really well. I have only experienced a little leakage on my super heavy days, but even then they work great. I make sure to wear a liner on those days."
