    "title": "Been avoiding using tampons for years due to a bad experience with irritation and uncomfortable feeling. My periods got heavier after I got my tubes tied. I knew I couldn't just rely on shifting pads. Searched Google reviews on tampons and decided to buy these in Super Plus. They are surprisingly easy to insert and I can't even feel it once its in. The best part is that I don't have to worry about embarrassing leaks. Love it! Won't go back to pads.",
