    "content": "I purchased the Tampax pearl triple pack. The fact that there are three sizes in one box is very helpful. Because while you're experiencing your.Period you have a different flow at the beginning, and in the middle and at the end. So it covers my heavy flow and through to my very light flow at the very end. I recommended these for my daughter and actually purchased another box for her. She was happy with those just like I am this is a good product and the fact that the applicators plastic is so much more comfortable than the cardboard ones you can buy. I will recommend this to anybody and everybody that will listen, lol."
