    "content": "I started using Tampax Pearl when I was 19 and stopped using them when I was 21. For every cycle they dried me out by the second day but because I knew the back up braid was what made these tampons the most absorbent I forced myself to keep using them. I finally stopped at 21 because I could no longer tolerate the dryness, irritation and discomfort anymore. I am now 25 and recently bought these again, hoping that the second chance would offer different results. Age made no difference!! I am still getting horribly dried out and irritated. There is nothing about this that makes me feel clean and hygienic. Terrible product! Tampax needs to make their tampons out of pure cotton and stop using these rayon, wood pulp and fiber finishes! Nothing healthy or sexy about that!!!"
