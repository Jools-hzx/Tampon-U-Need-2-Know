    "content": "For that time of the month, Tampax Pearl tampons are my go to product. These have a plastic applicator (for comfortable, smooth application), are compact enough to put in your purse, and come with three sizes to adapt with you as your flow changes. The box is big enough to get you through a couple periods as well."
