    "content": "These are the only tampons I use, and I've used them for years. They've updated the packaging over time, but the quality of the tampons themselves has been super consistent. I find that the sizes are the most appropriate for me (and I love the multipack). They're easy and comfortable to use, and I have had less problems with leaking than any other brand."
