    "content": "This is the perfect Tampax combination box for me! Unfortunately, I'm prone to an extremely, uncomfortable heavy flow on the first couple days, then a lighter but still heavy and then on my \"light\" days, I still require regular. I was buying multiple boxes before for the Super Plus and then the Super and Regular. The pearl version is my all time favorite. Comfortable, never have to worry about leaks and, easy to open, easy to use. You can't go wrong with Tampax pearl."
