    "title": "Best construction, still offensive price",
    "content": "I give these companies and their products the minimal rating until the price for consumers is actually relevant to the cost of manufacturing them. If you want an opinion that isn't cost related - Tampons are generally unsafe for you and bad for the environment. The ingredients used are not FDA regulated. The ingredients that we do know of are not safe for use inside your body. Tampons are the leading cause of Toxic Shock Syndrome, as they put you at risk of bacterial infection, even if used properly... If you're reading this, then you probably already know the warnings and have chosen tampons anyway, and want information to help you decide which one will suit your needs. So, here it is, my opinion without concern for safety or morality - The design makes it more easily concealed. The smooth plastic applicator feels less intrusive than the cardboard ones of the past, but it can be more difficult to hold on to with delicacy and can easily be pulled beyond the \"click\" during assembly, forcing you to either rethread it or grab a new one. The plastic wrapping is quieter and not as easily torn as the paper ones when shoved in your overburdened handbag. Unfortunately, this lead to some companies adding perforations for easy access - taking away some sterility of the packaging. Tampax has made an attempt to solve some of these issues by employing the \"no slip grip\" and having little flaps over the sealed opening on the side rather than using a plastic tube with holes across the top. If you must choose a tampon, this one is probably the best by construction, worst for price."
