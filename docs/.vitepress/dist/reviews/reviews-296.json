    "content": "I got these Tampax Pearl Trio Pack Regular/Super/Super Plus to try out, and they work very well. The applicators are very nice for 1 handed inserting. They are absorbent, and when inserted correctly, you are not able to feel them. The only downside to them is the packaging. Each type of tampon has slightly different packaging, which is hard to grab one quickly when they aren't separated in the box."
