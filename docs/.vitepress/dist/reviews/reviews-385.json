    "content": "Tampax is the only kind I use they are comfortable and the leak guard is the best 5 stars easy the material they are made of is why it's option is best on the market. Which is what I needed right now i really didn't want to go to the store. And the value is insane 100% Recommend. I always tie a knot at the bottom of the string before insertion so removal is easy to find and to grip"
