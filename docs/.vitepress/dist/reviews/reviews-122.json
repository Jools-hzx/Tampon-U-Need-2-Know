    "content": "I've been buying these exact tampons for YEARS. My only complaint is that they do at times start to leak before fully absorbing & as a result, I sometimes feel as though I'm wasting one. BUT regular is perfect for my periods & they're quick, easy, and comfortable- so I'll continue to repurchase, because if it's ain't totally brokeâ€¦ you know how it is."
