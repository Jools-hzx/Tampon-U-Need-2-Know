    "content": "I'm a tampax customer! I've tried each brand but i always come back to these because they are reasonably priced, well packaged, easy application and removal with zero leak issues. These applicators are easy to use, gentle and never caused irritations. The variety of absorbency's are fantastic allowing you to buy what you need without having to find any other brand that sells what's you want. The various sizes are perfect for your daily period flow and never leave me disappointed. After inserting it's very comfortable, sometimes you forget you're using it because it's that comfortable! The package is very discrete to open and handle, especially for those who are not as comfortable or open about their cycle. These are a great buy and must have item to keep on hand!"
