    "content": "I've always loved Tampax and more so when they came out with the easier pearl applications. I've always experienced light to heavy periods and always felt a combo pack would be perfect to have. You can store them in your purse, work drawer, bathrooms and guest bathrooms and your glovebox or console too. I love the non bulkiness of them since they can slide into your pocket and it's discreet. I'd say what I love to most about these, is that it has R, S & S+ so you know what you're using before opening it up."
