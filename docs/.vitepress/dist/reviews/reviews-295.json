    "content": "I am very happy with these tampons. I love the variety packs, so I can change the absorbency as I go through my cycle. Being able to buy I box is so much better than three. It also helps with organization and looks less cluttered under my sink with just the one box. These last an appropriate amount of time, and I haven't had any issues with leaks. The applicator has a raised design to help hold it while using, keeping your hand from slipping. The wrappers are color coded to make it easy to tell which one is the one you are looking for without having to look for the letter code. In my opinion the only thing that would make them better is if they were pocket size while in the package instead of the full length. That would make them a little easier for carrying with you while your out and more discrete."
