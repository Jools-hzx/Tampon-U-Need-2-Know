    "content": "One of my favorite tampons to use. Love this variety size pack - really helpful when ur dealing with different type of flow per day and the absorbency need fluctuates so often. Very helpful. Love the plastic applicator - comfortable to insert with no problems. Tampon is quite comfortable as it can be and absorbency is great. I rare to never have leaks with these and that's the goal. Definitely recommend."
