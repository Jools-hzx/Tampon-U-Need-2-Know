    "title": "Good value",
    "content": "Just the right variety and at a reasonable cost. Usually last me 2 months or around 2 cycles depending upon my flow rate and cycle length. I purchase the ultra tampons separately for the beginning part of my cycle and I prefer the Playtex brand for the ultras because they hold more and are more comfortable and don't leak as often as the Tampax brand."
