    "content": "Every time I try to use it I&#39;m getting hurt. Not practical applicator at all. You promote these new ones and you suspend the cardboard. That&#39;s not good P&amp;G. You don&#39;t think about us and you don&#39;t think of environment. I&#39;m sorry but in case I will not find cardboard in the market I promise to stop buying all P&amp;G products. At the moment I&#39;m buying as many cardboard I can find until you will give us the chance to choose. It&#39;s up to you to enforce the availability of cardboard. I would have given zero if I could. The worst product update ever."
